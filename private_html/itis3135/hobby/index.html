            My 3d Modeling Hobby Site
        </h1>
        <h2 onclick="displayPage(1)"><u>Who</u></h2>
            <div id="1">
                <img src="images/blodno.png" alt="blend" class="center">
                <p>I am Thomas Benfield. I am a junior at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I grew up in Statesville North Carolina. I started my time at UNCC in 2021.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I enjoy a variety of hobbies such as weight lifting and playing video games. I browse social media from time to time but rarely post. I took this class in particular because I thought it would be interesting.</p>
            </div>
        <h2 onclick="displayPage(2)"><u>What</u></h2>
            <div id="2">
                <img src="images/bendono.png" alt="blend" class="center">
                <p>The hobby I chose to make this page around was my hobby of 3d modeling. I like to make 3d models of a variety of things. I am not terribly gifted at traditional art forms though I find that I can at least make something servicable in a 3d environment.</p>
                <br>
                <p>My software of choice is blender. I personally have it downloaded through steam because it keeps me from having to go through the effort of updating it myself. It's free software and I find it to be a relatively simple to use creative outlet. It's great to use in down time and it feels good to use as the more time invested, the better you get at using it.</p>
            </div>

        <h2 onclick="displayPage(3)"><u>When</u></h2>
            <div id="3">
                <img src="images/bondini.png" alt="blend" class="center">
                <p>I first started using the program in my junior year of high school when I was introduced to it by a friend. I find myself using it a lot whenever I have free time and don't want to get committed to playing a video game. I find it best to use whenever friends are pre occupied and I have no work left to do.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I personally prefer to use it when I am at home as my home computer can handle more than the laptop that I generally travel with. Though I do still use it when I am on road trips or somewhere that I don't have internet access because it doesn't require as much power if I'm making a simple model.</p>
            </div>
        <h2 onclick="displayPage(4)"><u>Where</u></h2>
            <div id="4">
                <img src="images/owbbongo.png" alt="blend" class="center">
                <p>I usually prefer to 3d model at home. When I'm comfortable and working on my home computer is when I do my best work. My home computer generally performs the best out of any device that I have the software installed on. I also have multiple monitors at home which help when I want to make textures on one monitor and models on another.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I also occasionaly model on my laptop. This is what I use when I'm anywhere but home. I generally model away from home on trips or at school when I have somewhere comfortable to sit between classes.</p>
            </div>
        <h2 onclick="displayPage(5)"><u>How</u></h2>
            <div id="5">
                <img src="images/suvanoe.png" alt="blend" class="center">
                <p>I model with my keyboard and mouse as is standard. I've memorized a good few hotkeys so I can be pretty efficient once I get into a flow. My ideas generally come sporatically though so there are times when I'm just looking at the screen thinking about what I would even make.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I try to make things by hand most of the time. I like manually editing vertezed rather than sculpting. This is mainly because I prefer a more blocky and sharp style with crisp lines. So I generally avoid sculpting and too many subdivisions.</p>
            </div>
        <h2 onclick="displayPage(6)"><u>Why</u></h2>
            <div id="6">
                <img src="images/superstar.png" alt="blend" class="center">
                <p>I model because I find it to be a wonderful creative outlet. I have a lot of ideas that I struggle to compose in other forms of art and therefore found my place in 3d modeling. I've been modeling for a long time and though I haven't made anything I would consider spectacular, I would say that I've improved.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I think that had I not found 3d modeling a lot of my creative ideas such as character or world designs would have stagnated and died after floating around in my head for a while. So I'm glad I found the software as it bolstered my creativity and gave me a drive to improve in my own creative efforts.</p>
