        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://rayconglobal.com/">Raycon Global</a></h3>
            <p>
                Raycon global is an earbud and headphones producer who do most of their business <br>
                online. They include plenty of links to navigate their site which is easy to inderstand <br>
                at a glance and pleasant to look at.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast: </strong>A bright background and dark text make it easy to read and orange hovered links make them stand out well.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>The site is in split into sections which repeat header and body font in a way which makes sense.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>The website is aligned in a way which makes sense such as lists and links in the header being aligned left and body content being aligned center.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>Everything is in a place which makes sense and nothing feels out of place or disjointed.</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://bonzi.link/">Bonzi Buddy</a></h3>
            <p>DO NOT CLICK ANY LINKS ON THIS PAGE</p>
            <p>
                Bonzi Buddy is a download site for an internet helper (virus) which is supposed to make <br>
                browsing the web easier. The website is covered in animated gifs of the purple monkey <br>
                Bonzi and the bullet points are even bananas. How nice.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast: </strong>The contrast on the page is mostly fine, everything is readable though pruple on green is a bit grating.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>All of the basic content text is fairly repetitious with the same font though almost every logo and image is different leading to a very unhinged page.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>Text on the page is aligned center except the odd paragraph or two making them feel out of place. Images everywhere, in the center, on the sides, in the corners.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>Download links are located at the top and bottom of the page leading to confusion while information about the program itself is scattered through the page.</li>
            </ul>
